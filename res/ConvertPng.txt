This is just a very simple utility program, which converts a png into a corresponding c file.
It supports the following sprite sizes: 8x16, 24x32, 32x32
The png must contain one additional line at the top. The first four pixel of this line are used to define the used palette (four different gray scales, like: 0xFFFFFF, 0x646464, 0xb4b4b4, 0x646464 and 0x000000)
The first pixel will be the transparent color.

The png file's name must contain the bank number: myAwesomeSprite.b3.png

You can pack multiple frames into a single png file, by just drawing them below each other.
For example a 24x32 sprite with 4 frames will have a png size of 24x161

Usage:
Just drag and drop a single png file onto the ConvertPng executable and it will generate the corresponding .c and .h files into the src subdirectory.

If you just start the ConvertPng executable directly, it will convert all png files inside it's directory.
